# ProxSpot
A client prototype of a system developed whilst competing in the Smart Future hackaton organised for ICTDays at the University of Trento. We finished third at the competition!<br/>
Built with React and Firebase integration.

## What is it?
It consists in a group of proximity sensors that can be programmed to satisfy the needs of a specific business.
Those sensors can be applied to identify if a product is present in a shelf of a supermarket, if a chair is free in a library and so on.
Each sensor communicates those data to a central hub programmed by the business that has bought them. They are then elaborated to obtain statistics like the usage of specific instruments in a gym or how much a certain product in a supermarket is sold. On the side of the customer, instead, those data can be retrived from a web application and can help them to have a better experience in places that use this technology. They can understand if it is the case to go search some groceries at the supermarket or if it is the case to remain at home instead of going to the gym and wait for an instrument. <br />

The technology is extremely flexible and cheap.
